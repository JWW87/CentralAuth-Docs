# Billing

This tab allows you to view and manage your current plan and billing history.

## Current plan

The current plan section displays your current subscription plan. If you have a paid plan, you can change or cancel your plan by clicking on the `Change plan` button. This will open a popup where you can select a new plan or cancel your current plan by selecting the Free plan.

The `subscription status` field shows the status of your current subscription. If your subscription is active, it will show `Active`. If you have any expired invoices, it will show `Inactive`. In that case, a warning banner will appear at the top of the page with a link to your billing portal where you can update your payment method and pay any outstanding invoices.

The `mandate status` field shows the status of your credit card mandate. If your mandate is active, it will show `Active`. If your mandate is inactive, it will show `Inactive`. In that case, a warning banner will appear at the top of the page with a link to your billing portal where you can update your payment method and re-enable your mandate.

## Usage

The usage section displays your current usage for the billing period. It shows the number of users active in the current billing period and the number of users included in your plan. It also shows an estimation of the total number of MAUs (Monthly Active Users) at the end of the current billing period, the end date of this period, and the estimated amount of the next invoice based on your plan and usage.

## Start a paid plan

If you are on the Free plan, you can start a paid plan by selecting one of the paid plans. A popup will appear where you can enter your billing information. Click on the `confirm` button to enter your payment details and start your paid plan.

## Invoices

The invoices section displays a list of your past invoices with the payment status. You can view and download each invoice by clicking on the `Download invoice` button next to the invoice. The invoices are listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent invoice at the top.
