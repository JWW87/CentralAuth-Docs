- Plan changes don't affect your current billing period

## Usage-Based Pricing

### What are Monthly Active Users (MAU)?

Monthly Active Users are unique users who have logged into your application during the current billing month. This ensures you only pay for actual usage, not for the number of registered users on your organization.

### Usage-Based Pricing

Each plan includes a certain number of MAUs. If you exceed your included amount, additional usage fees apply. The exact pricing tiers and included MAU amounts for each plan can be found on our [pricing page](https://centralauth.com/pricing).

### Monitoring Your Usage

You can monitor your current MAU count and usage trends in your tenant dashboard under the "Billing" or "Usage" section.

## Managing Your Subscription

### Changing Your Plan

1. Go to your tenant dashboard
2. Navigate to "Billing"
3. Select "Change Plan"
4. Choose your new plan
5. Confirm the change

:::note
All plan changes (both upgrades and downgrades) take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. You'll continue to have access to your current plan's features until then.
