# Translations

:::note
Translation are not available on the **Free** plan.
:::

When starting the login flow, you can pass an object with translations as a query parameter. This allows you to override or translate the default strings on the login pages.

## CentralAuth NPM library

When using the CentralAuth NPM library, you can pass the `translations` object as config parameter to the `login` or `loginHTTP` method, for example:

```typescript
await authClient.login(req, {
  translations: {
    login: "Welcome! Log in to My Website.",
    loginAttemptSuccess: "That's all folks! Close this tab and be on your merry way.",
    loginAttemptError: "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again.",
    undo: "Undo login at My Website"
  }
});
```

## Manual integration

If you cannot use the NPM library, you can pass the translations object as a base64 stringified JSON object in the `translations` query parameter of the login URL. For example:

```typescript
const translations = {
  login: "Welcome! Log in to My Website.",
  loginAttemptSuccess: "That's all folks! Close this tab and be on your merry way.",
  loginAttemptError: "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again.",
  undo: "Undo login at My Website"
};

const translationsBase64String = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(config.translations)).toString("base64");

const loginUrl = `https://centralauth.com/login?translations=${translationsBase64String}&client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&state=STATE`;
```

## Available translations

You can set the following translations:
