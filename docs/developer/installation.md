# Installation

You can use any OAuth 2.0 library to integrate CentralAuth into your application. If you are using a NodeJS application, you can use the official CentralAuth NPM library. Install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save centralauth
```

If you are building a React Native (Expo) app, install some additional Expo packages as well:

```bash
npx expo install expo-crypto expo-device expo-linking expo-web-browser expo-secure-store
```
