# Error handling

When interacting with the CentralAuth API, any request that fails will return a JSON object with error information. The error object will contain the following properties:
- `errorCode`: The error code of the error. This is a string that can be used to identify the error.
- `message`: A human readable string that describes the error. This string can be used to display an error message to the user.

:::warning
If you manually integrate the authentication flow in your application, the error handling for the callback method is slightly different. If anything went wrong during the authentication flow, the callback URL will be called with an `error` and `error_description` query parameter.

## Error codes
These are the error codes that can be returned by the CentralAuth API:
| Error code                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Keep in mind that unexpected errors may occur that do not match any of the error codes listed above. In such cases, only the error message may be available.

## Error handling in the NPM library
When using the CentralAuth NPM library, you can handle errors by using the `catch` statement on the `Promise` object returned by the methods on the `CentralAuthClass`. The `catch` statement will contain an object with the error information. You can use this error object to display an error message to the user, redirect the user to the login screen, or implement any other kind of error handling.

:::tip
If something went wrong during the authentication flow, you can catch the error and redirect the user back to the login page. Use the `errorMessage` property to show the error message to the user. Using the [quick example](/developer/quick-example), it would look like this:

```tsx
import { CentralAuthClass } from "centralauth/server";

export async function GET(req: Request, props: { params: Promise<{ action: "login" | "callback" | "user" | "logout" }> }) {
  const { action } = await props.params;
  
  const requestUrl = new URL(req.url);
  const searchParams = requestUrl.searchParams;

  const authClient = new CentralAuthClass({
    clientId: process.env.AUTH_ORGANIZATION_ID,
    secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
    authBaseUrl: process.env.AUTH_BASE_URL,
    callbackUrl: `${requestUrl.origin}/api/auth/callback`
  });

  let response = Response.json(null);
  try {
    if (action == "login")
      response = await authClient.login(req, { errorMessage: searchParams.get("error_message") });
    if (action == "callback")
      response =  await authClient.callback(req);
    if (action == "user")
      response =  await authClient.user(req);
    if (action == "logout")
      response =  await authClient.logout(req);
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    //When an error occurs during the callback, retry the login procedure
    if (action == "callback")
      response = new Response(null, {
        status: 302,
        headers: {
          "Location": `/api/auth/login?error_message=${error.message}`
        }
      })
  }
  return response;
}
```
