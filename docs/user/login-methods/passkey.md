# Passkeys

A passkey is a simple and secure way to log into your accounts without using traditional passwords. Think of it as a digital key that's unique to you and your device, making it much safer than remembering and typing passwords.

## How it works

- **Just use your device**: Log in using your fingerprint, face, or device PIN
- **Works everywhere**: Use it on your phone, tablet, or computer
- **Stays safe**: Your passkey can't be stolen or guessed like passwords can
- **Easy to use**: No more remembering complex passwords
- **Always protected**: Keeps your accounts secure from fake websites

## Why use passkeys?

- More secure than regular passwords
- Quick and easy to use
- Can't be copied or stolen
- Protects you from scams

## How to register a passkey

  - **Windows**: Windows Hello, PIN or password
  - **Android**: Fingerprint, Face Unlock or PIN
  - **iOS**: FaceID, TouchID or PIN 

- Once you have set up your passkey, it will be saved on your device and you can use it to log in anywhere you use the same account.
