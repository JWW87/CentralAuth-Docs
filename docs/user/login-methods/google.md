- Enter your Google credentials to log in.

- If you cancel the authentication flow at Google, you can start the process again by clicking on the **Google** button.

:::info
When you log in for the first time, Google will ask you to authorize CentralAuth to access your Google account information. CentralAuth will only access your email address for authentication purposes. Click on the **Continue** button to authorize CentralAuth. You only need to do this once.
