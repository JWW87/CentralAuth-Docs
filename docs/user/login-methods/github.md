- Enter your GitHub credentials to log in.

- If you cancel the authentication flow at GitHub, you can start the process again by clicking on the **GitHub** button.

:::info
When you log in for the first time, GitHub will ask you to authorize CentralAuth to access your GitHub account information. CentralAuth will only access your primary email address for authentication purposes. Click on the **Authorize GitHub** button to authorize CentralAuth. You only need to do this once.
