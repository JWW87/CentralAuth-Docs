# Captcha challenges

CentralAuth uses a Captcha mechanism to protect your account from unauthorized access. When you log in, you may be asked to complete a Captcha challenge to verify that you are a human user. This helps prevent automated attacks on your account.

CentralAuth uses three different kinds of Captcha challenges:
- A simple checkbox that you can click to verify that you are not a robot.
- A challenge that asks you to click on 5 numbers in ascending order.
- A puzzle to click on a specific shape in a random pattern.

## Checkbox

The checkbox Captcha challenge is the simplest type of Captcha. To complete the challenge, click on the checkbox next to the label `I am a human` to verify that you are not a robot.

## Number Challenge

The number challenge asks you to click on 5 numbers in ascending order. To complete the challenge, click on the numbers in the correct order. If you clicked the numbers in the wrong order, you will be asked to try again.

**Example**

## Puzzle Challenge

The puzzle challenge asks you to click on a specific shape in a random pattern. To complete the challenge, click on the shape that matches the description. If you clicked the wrong shape, you will be asked to try again.

**Example**

In this example, you would need to click on the only open circle shape to complete the challenge. To ensure accuracy, please double-check the shape description before selecting.
