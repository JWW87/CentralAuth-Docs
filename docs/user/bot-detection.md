# AI bot detection

The login flow is designed to detect suspicious activity and block bots from trying to log in. This is done by analyzing the user's behavior during the login process. If the system detects that the user is a bot, it will block the user from logging in. 

You might get a warning message that the login attempt was blocked because of suspicious behaviour. When this is the case, please try to log in again. 

## FAQ

### Why was my login attempt blocked?

There are multiple safeguards in place to prevent bots from logging in to your account. One of these is detection of unnatural behaviour, like fast mouse clicks or keyboard input. If you are using a browser extension that automates your login, this might be the cause of the issue.

### What can I do to prevent this?

If you are using a browser extension that automates your login, please disable it and try again. If you are not using any browser extensions, try to type your email address manually or wait a few seconds between clicks. If you are still having issues, please contact support and provide as much information as possible about your login attempt. This will help us to identify the issue and fix it.

### Is my account still safe?

Yes, your account is still safe. The login attempt was blocked because of suspicious behaviour, but your account has not been compromised. 

### Can I try again if I get a warning about suspicious behaviour?

Yes, you can try to log in again. Your account will not be blocked if you get this warning.
