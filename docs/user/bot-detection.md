# AI bot detection

The login flow is designed to detect suspicious activity and block bots from trying to log in. This is done by analyzing the user's behavior during the login process. If the system detects that the user is a bot, it will block the user from logging in. 

You might get a warning message that the login attempt was blocked because it was detected as a bot. When this is the case, please try to log in again. If the issue persists, please contact us via the contact form.
